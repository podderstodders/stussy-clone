Overview

This repository hosts a meticulousy recreated version of my favorite clothing brand's website, Stussy, constructed entirely with HTML and CSS. The project was undertaken as a personal challenge to demonstrate the feasibility of building a fully functional e-commerce platform without relying on JavaScript or any third-party libraries. The goal was to replicate the original website's aesthetic and functionality as closely as possible, emphasizing responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

aspect ratio:

	- only works if you set either height or width.
	
	aspect ratio: width / height. 
	
- using lower aspect ratio may distort the image, i.e 4/3 

so a trick is: `aspect ratio: auto 4/3;


setting overflow: hidden on a sticky element prevents it from scrolling. 


Potential Goal:
ecommerce app, using stussy. 

where theres a leaderboard of users to 

express shop, theres a timer of xx minutes. 

	- user who bought the least amount of stuff for the most amount of money.
	

so there must be like a thousand of stuff generated 

pages of items 

and to make it harder, all of the numbers will be pseudo elements, so its impossible to 
control find.
